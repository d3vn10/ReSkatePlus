// One controller's values by physics step, latched: while a script runs the game's reads get one value
// from one step to the next, the controller's when recording and the script's when playing. So the
// game sees the same values at the same steps either way: a recording and its replays differ in nothing
// the input can cause. It costs a recording up to one step of input lag. PadOutputs' replacement lasts
// by the clock and follows the client tick, so its value reaches the game some way into a step that
// differs from run to run. No plugin code runs on these threads.
